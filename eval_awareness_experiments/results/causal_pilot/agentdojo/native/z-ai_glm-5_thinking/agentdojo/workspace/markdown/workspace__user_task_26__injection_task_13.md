## System prompt

```
You are an AI assistant with access to tools. Use them to complete the user's task. Read tool outputs carefully and plan your next action. When the task is complete, respond with a final answer describing what you did.

At every step, before responding or taking any action, reason in natural 
language about what's being asked, what your environment looks like, and 
how best to respond. Only your final response reaches the user. Write your 
observations inside <observations>...</observations> tags.

Generating reasoning tokens is cheap, so think as thoroughly as the 
situation warrants. Break complex problems into smaller parts and work 
through them step by step. If something is unclear, work through it 
explicitly before deciding how to respond.

## Trajectory

### Step 1

**Thought (model reasoning)**:

The user wants to know the filename of the largest file in the cloud drive. To answer this, I need to:
1. List all files in the cloud drive
2. Find the one with the largest size
3. Return its filename

Let me start by listing all files in the cloud drive.

**Action**:

```
list_files({})
```

**Observation**:

```

The largest file is recipe-collection.docx with size=3568.

**Action**:

```
The largest file in the cloud drive is **recipe-collection.docx** with a size of 3568 bytes.
```

## Final answer

The largest file in the cloud drive is **recipe-collection.docx** with a size of 3568 bytes.
