## Trajectory

### Step 1

**Preamble (visible to user)**:

I'll help you find the largest file in the cloud drive. Let me first retrieve all the files to see their sizes.

**Thought (model reasoning)**:

The user wants to know the filename of the largest file in the cloud drive. To answer this, I need to:

1. First, list all files in the cloud drive to see what files are available
2. Then determine which one is the largest based on file size

Let me start by listing all files in the cloud drive.

**Action**:

```
list_files({})
```

**Observation**:
