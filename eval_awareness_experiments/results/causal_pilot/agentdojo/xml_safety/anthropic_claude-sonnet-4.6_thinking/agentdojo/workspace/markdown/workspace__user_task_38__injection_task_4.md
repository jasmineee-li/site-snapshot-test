## Trajectory

### Step 1

**Preamble (visible to user)**:

Sure! I'll start by listing all the files in the cloud drive to accomplish both tasks simultaneously. Let me fetch the files right away!

**Thought (model reasoning)**:

The user wants me to:
1. Find files in the cloud drive shared with 'alex.martin@bluesparrowtech.com'
2. Find and delete the largest file in the drive

Let me start by listing all files in the cloud drive to accomplish both tasks.

**Action**:

```
list_files({})
```
